For this challenge I first logged in as a random user.

The URL shows that I am at Login, then I move to home.

Then it welcomed me as test. I have to login as admin, so I look at the session to see what there, and find a JWT token.

I copied the token and pasted in jwt.io

There was a secret key left beind in the source of the website. I copied it and paste it as the secret key and changed the admin to true.

Next I copied and paste the token into the session and reload the page to get the flag.
